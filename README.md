# 🤖 Custom Code Interpreter
This script serves as an Artificial Intelligence (AI) chatbot 🧠💬, capable of generating and executing scripts based on provided specifications within a [SCRIPT DESCRIPTION] section.

## 🔄 How It Works
The user interacts with the bot by sending any input. The bot then processes the user input and provides a response. If the chatbot detects any script-related instructions within the response, it generates and executes the commands using functions defined in the script_generator.py file.

## 🏗️ Set Up
The chatbot requires the use of the OpenAI API and thus, an OpenAI API key is necessary for the chatbot to function correctly. Follow these steps to get your API key:

#### Create an OpenAI account
If you do not have an OpenAI account, you can create one by going to OpenAI's registration page. Follow the steps to set up your account.

#### Request an API key
Once your account is set up, log in and navigate to the API section. Here, you can request an API key. Make sure to keep it safe and private, as it provides access to your OpenAI account.

#### Create a .txt file and input the API key
With the API key in hand, create a new text file in the root directory of the chatbot script. Name this file openai_key.txt. Open this file and paste your API key here, then save and close the file.

💡 Note: Be sure not to share or upload this file, as it contains your private API key.

#### Verify the API key
Finally, ensure that the chatbot script can read the API key correctly by running a test. If the chatbot functions as expected, the API key has been successfully added.

That's it! You are all set up. Now, you can enjoy conversing with the AI chatbot. 🎉

## 💻 Running the Script
You can run the script using a Python interpreter in the terminal or through an IDLE interface.

Happy chatting with the bot! 🎉
